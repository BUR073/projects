<h1>Installing python</h1>

<p>

    Python 2 comes preinstalled on older versions of macOS.
    This is no longer the case for current versions of macOS,
    starting with macOS Catalina.

    There are two installation methods on macOS:

    <ol>
        <li><strong>The official installer:</strong>This method involves 
            downloading the official installer from the 
            Python.org website and running it on your machine.
        </li>

        <li><strong>The homebrew package manager:</strong> This method involves 
            downloading and installing the Homebrew package manager
            if you dont already have it installed, and then typing
             a command into a terminal application.
        </li>
    </ol> 


</p>

<h1>How to install from the offical installer</h1>

<h2>1. Download the official installer</h2>

<p>
    Follow these steps to download the full installer:
    <ol>
        <li>
            Open a browser window and navigate to the Python.org 
            <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/">downloads page for MacOS</a>
        </li>

        <li>Under the “Python Releases for Mac OS X” heading, click
            the link for the Latest Python 3 Release - Python 3.x.x.
            As of this writing, the latest version was Python 3.8.4.
        </li>

        <li>
            Scroll to the bottom and click macOS 64-bit installer to start the download.
        </li>

    </ol>
    When the installer is finished downloading, move on to the next step.
</p>

<h2>
    2. Run the installer
</h2>

<p>
    Run the installer by double-clicking the downloaded file. You should see the following window:
</p>

<p>
    Follow these steps to complete the installation:

    <ol>
        <li>
            Press Continue a few times until youre asked to agree 
            to the software license agreement. Then click Agree.
        </li>

        <li>
            Youll be shown a window that tells you the install destination
             and how much space it will take. You most likely dont want to
            change the default location, so go ahead and click Install to 
            start the installation.
        </li>

        <li>
            When the installer is finished copying files, click Close to close 
            the installer window.
        </li>
    
    </ol>

    <strong>Congratulations</strong>—you now have the latest version of Python 3 on your macOS computer!

<h1>
    How to install from Homebrew
</h1>

<p>
    For users who need to install from the command line, 
    especially those who wont be using Python to develop 
    graphical user interfaces with the Tkinter module, 
    the Homebrew package manager is a good option. You
    can install from the Homebrew package manager in two steps.


</p>

<h2>
    Step 1: Install Homebrew 
</h2>

<p>
    If you already have Homebrew installed, 
    then you can skip this step. If you dont
    have Homebrew installed, then use the following
    procedure to install Homebrew:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        Open a browser and navigate to 
        <a href="http://brew.sh/">http://brew.sh</a>
    </li>

    <li>
        You should see a command for installing Homebrew near 
        the top of the page under the tile “Install Homebrew.” 
        This command will be something like the following:   

        <code>
            $ /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
        </code>
    </li>

    <li>
        Open your terminal and run the command
    </li>

    <li>
        Enter your macOS user password when prompted.
    </li>

</ol>

<p>
    Depending on your Internet connection, 
    it may take a few minutes to download 
    all of Homebrews required files. 
    Once the installation is complete, 
    youll end up back at the shell 
    prompt in your terminal window.

    
</p>

<p>
    Now that Homebrew is installed, 
    youre ready to install Python.
</p>

<h2>
    Step 2: Install Python
</h2>

<p>
    Follow these steps to complete the installation with Homebrew:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        Open a terminal application.
    </li>

    <li>
        Type in the following command to upgrade Homebrew:

        <code>
            $ brew update && brew upgrade
        </code>


    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    Installing with Homebrew is now as straightforward as running 
    the command brew install python3. This will download and set
     up the latest version of Python on your machine.
</p>

<p>
    You can make sure everything went correctly by testing if you can 
    access Python from the terminal:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        Open a terminal.
    </li>

    <li>
        Type pip3 and press enter
    </li>

    <li>
        You should see the help text from <a href="https://realpython.com/what-is-pip/">Pythons pip package manager.</a>
        If you get an error message running pip3, then go through the 
        install steps again to make sure you have a working installation.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    <strong>Congratulations</strong>—you now have Python on your macOS system!
