<h2>
    Python Conditions and If statements
</h2>

<p>
    Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Equals: a == b
    </li>

    <li>
        Not Equals: a != b
    </li>

    <li>
        Less than: a < b
    </li>

    <li>
        Less than or equal to: a <= b
    </li>

    <li>
        Greater than: a > b
    </li>

    <li>
        Greater than or equal to: a >= b
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in "if statements" and loops.
</p>

<p>
    An "if statement" is written by using the if keyword.
</p>

<pre>
    <code>
a = 33
b = 200
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
    </code>
</pre>

<p>
    In this example we use two variables, a and b, 
    which are used as part of the if statement to 
    test whether b is greater than a. As a is 33, 
    and b is 200, we know that 200 is greater than 33, 
    and so we print to screen that "b is greater than a".
</p>

<h2>
    Indentation
</h2>

<p>
    Python relies on indentation (whitespace at the beginning of a line) 
    to define scope in the code. Other programming languages often use 
    curly-brackets for this purpose.
</p>

<p>
    If statement, without indentation (will raise an error):
</p>

<pre>
    <code>
a = 33
b = 200
if b > a:
print("b is greater than a") # you will get an error
    </code>
</pre>

<h2>
    Elif
</h2>

<p>
    The elif keyword is pythons way of saying "if the previous conditions were not true, 
    then try this condition".
</p>

<pre>
    <code>
a = 33
b = 33
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
elif a == b:
  print("a and b are equal")
    </code>
</pre>

<p>
    In this example a is equal to b, so the first condition is not true, 
    but the elif condition is true, so we print to screen that "a and b are equal".
</p>

<p>
    You can also have an else without the elif:
</p>

<pre>
    <code>
a = 200
b = 33
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
else:
  print("b is not greater than a")
    </code>
</pre>
