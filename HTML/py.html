<h2>
    Hello world program
</h2>

<p> 
    The hello world program is widely known to be the first program written by new programers.
    Python has a built in function for displaying text within the console 
</p>

<p>
    This function is called: <code>print()</code> 
</p>

<p>
    To utilize this function you need to give it what you want to display, 
    this is done by writing in between the brackets.
    So for the Hello World program it would be: <code>print("Hello World")</code>
</p>

<p>
    Now we have looked at the most basic program in python, we can move on to harder programs
